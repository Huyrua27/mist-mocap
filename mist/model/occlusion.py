"""Occlusion-aware helpers. Task #18 (WS2), addresses the occlusion research gap.

Two mechanisms, both driven by per-keypoint visibility v ∈ [0,1] of shape (B,T,J):
  1. Input gating   — zero-out unreliable keypoints before embedding.
  2. Attention bias — down-weight frames whose keypoints are mostly occluded, by adding
                      log(reliability) to the attention logits over those key frames.
When visibility is None (e.g. clean synthetic data) both are no-ops.
